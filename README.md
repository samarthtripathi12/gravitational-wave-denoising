# gravitational-wave-denoising
Experimental physics project demonstrating gravitational wave signal denoising using Fourier analysis, band-pass filtering, and matched filtering inspired by LIGO methodology.

## Baseline Signal Generation

This project begins by generating a clean sinusoidal signal and introducing controlled Gaussian noise to simulate real-world detector measurements. This baseline establishes a reference point before applying denoising techniques.
